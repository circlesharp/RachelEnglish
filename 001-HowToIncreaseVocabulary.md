In this American English pronunciation video, we are going to over how to increase your vocabulary.  
One of the challenges in learning a foreign language is remembering all of the new vocabulary.  
In this video, we are going to go over a few  tips for learning new words, and for remembering them.  
First, expose yourself to the language. For example, READ.  
I still learn English words from reading. I find that every couple of months, the NEW YORK TIMES uses a word that either I've never heard before, or that I've heard, but I am not totally solid on the meaning.  
So I look it up, learn the meaning, and then go back to the sentence and solidify it.  
One good idea is to think of another word that you know you can replace it with in that sentence.  
A word that wouldn't change the meaning.  
Then say the sentence with that word.  
Tying the new word to a word you already know, and studying it in the context of the sentence will help you remember it.
If you know my channel, you know it's a pronunciation channel.  
Always learn the pronunciation when you learn a new word.  
When you look up a word in a dictionary, the pronunciation is always right there.  
Many online dictionaries also play an audio file so you can hear a native speaker say the word.
