## main idea
------------
### 11 - it
> it won't be (ɪt| , stop t)  
> it always (ɪd always, flat t)
### 12 - for
> This is for work (fər, drop the vowel)  
> I got it for my birthday  
> What's for dinner?  
### 13 - not
It's an abrupt stop of air in the N to signify the T:
> didn't, doesn't, can't, shouldn't,won't  
If you don't use a contraction, then we're often stressing it.
> I do NOT want to see her right now (stop t, wanna)  
### 14 - on
When it's unstressed, that gives good contrast to the longer, clearer stressed words, and this contrast is very important in American English.  
Low in volume, low in pitch, not very clear.
> Put it on the table
### 15 - with
with a voiced TH, wið
with a unvoiced TH, wiθ
> It's with the other one (wi the)  
### 16 - he
> What does he want? (dəz i)  
> dropping the H reductions: `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuOw_KnFk3Y&list=PLrqHrGoMJdTRJcd1rrp1qfYBu9VgTIfoX`  
### 17 - as
> He's as tall as me (əz tall əz me)  
### 18 - you
> What are you doing? (jər)  
### 19 - do
Our first content word. Content words are nouns, verbs, adjective, and adverbs.  
They're usually stressed in a sentence.  
Actually, this word can reduce. It depends on how it's being used in a sentence. In a question, where there's another verb, we often reduce it.  
> What do you think? (də jə)  
> I do have a video (stress du)
### 20 - at
> She's at school (ət |)  
> Stop T & Flat T: `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ8p85NRAsI`
