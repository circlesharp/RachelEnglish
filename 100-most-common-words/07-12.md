1. title: English Words – The Top 10 – Pronunciation Guide – Learn English (American English)

## main idea
------------
So many of the 100 most common words are function words and they reduce. It is completely unnatural to fully pronounce each word in American English.  
In order to make those short syllables really short, some words in American English, some of the most common words, reduce. This means a sound changes or is dropped.  
> This is for work, etc.
### 1 - the
> the most  
> the other
### 2 - be
> I'm sorry (m sorry)  
> you're going to be okay (jər gonna)  
> It's cool (ts_cool)  
> We're running late (wər running)  
> They're okay (ðər)  
### 3 - to
> reduce to (tə)  
> Let's go to the beach (go də)
### 4 - of
> kind of, sort of (kind ə, sort ə)  
### 5 - and
> and I think (ən I)  
> and I think (n I)  
### 6 - a / 32 - an
> a (ə)
> an (ən)  
### 7 - in
> He's in love (very short and fast, not stressed)  
### 8 - that
> that I (ðət, flat T, vowel&diphthong)
> that she (ðət, stop T, consonant)  
### 9 - have
> I've  
> you've  
> he's (hiz)  
> she's (ʃiz)  
> it's (ɪts)  
> we've  
> they've (ðəɪv)
### 10 - I
> I think so (ə think so)

## fancy word
-------------
1. rhythm -> rhythm in American English is extremely import...
2. contrast -> this contrast is the rhythm of American English...
3. schwa -> very fast with a schwa...
4. consonant -> This is when the next word begins with a consonant...
5. vowel, diphthong -> if the next word begins with a vowel or diphthong...
6. conjugate -> and I assume this means the word to be conjugated...
7. contraction -> they will almost always be said in a contraction...
