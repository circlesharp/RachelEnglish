### Content Words & Function Words
We have two kinds of words in English: content words, which are nouns, verb, adjectives, and adverbs; and function words, which are all the other kinds of words.  

### words generally reduce one, maybe two ways
It's not a mystery how to understand how we reduce words and how to practice them.

### Pay Attention to these Unstressed Words
An effective way to practice your English is to take the text from a video, like a TED talk or your favorite TV show.  
But make sure you have the transcript, preferably printed out.
As you listen to a phrase, circle the words that pop out, that have that up-down shape, that are the most stressed. You might have to listen to the same phrase more than once.  

But as you focus on this, your ear will become more tuned to the stress.
Study the phrases. You're looking at, not only the words you circled, but the words you didn't circle, these are the unstressed or reduced words.  

So as you study native speakers, pay attention to these unstressed words. Pay attention to the reductions.
