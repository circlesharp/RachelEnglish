## main idea
------------
### 1 - what you
`t y` -> [tʃ]
> You guys know what you'd like?

### 2 - ed
The word with `ed` ending has 3 possible pronunciation:
1. [d] -> grilled -> the sound before is a voiced consonant
2. [t] -> hashed, stuffed -> the sound before is a unvoiced consonant
3. [e] -> before sounds t / d

### 3 - potatoes
[d] -> the t between 2 vowels or diphthongs, except it's stressed.


## fancy word
-------------
1. grilled cheddar sandwich
2. a side of -> 好像没有啥特别意思，一例？一碟？
3. hearty -> 亲切的、丰盛的
4. rustic -> 淳朴的、乡下的 (rust -> 铁锈)
5. spinach -> [ˈspɪnɪtʃ] -> 菠菜
6. runny -> the yolk is really runny -> 流鼻涕的 流眼泪的 太稀的 水分过多的 软的
7. thick -> 厚
